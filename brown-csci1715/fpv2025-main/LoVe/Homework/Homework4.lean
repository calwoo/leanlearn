/- ## Question 1 (4 points): Dot Notation

After defining structures and inductive types, functions that operate on these
types can be accessed through the dot notation. This is syntactically similar to
methods in Object-Oriented Programming. This question will guide you through
how to use it.

First, we define a structure: -/

section

structure Point (α : Type) where
  x : α
  y : α
  deriving Repr   -- For display in `#eval`

/- It comes with some existing functions: -/

#check Point       -- a Type
#check @Point.rec  -- the eliminator
#check @Point.mk   -- the constructor
#check @Point.x    -- a projection
#check @Point.y    -- a projection

#eval Point.x (Point.mk 10 20)
#eval Point.y (Point.mk 10 20)
#check Point.mk 10 20

/- You can avoid the prefix `Point` by using the command `open Point`. -/

open Point

example {α : Type} (a b : α) : x (mk a b) = a :=
  rfl

example {α : Type} (a b : α) : y (mk a b) = b :=
  rfl

/- Given `p : Point Nat`, the dot notation `p.x` is shorthand for `Point.x p`.
This provides a convenient way of accessing the fields of a structure. -/

def p := Point.mk 10 20

#check p.x  -- ℕ
#eval p.x   -- 10
#eval p.y   -- 20

/- The dot notation is convenient not just for accessing the projections of a
structure, but also for applying functions defined in a namespace with the same
name. For example, since `p : Point`, the expression `p.add q` is shorthand for
`Point.add p q` in the example below.-/

def Point.add (p q : Point Nat) :=
  mk (p.x + q.x) (p.y + q.y)

def q : Point Nat := Point.mk 30 40

#eval p.add q  -- {x := 40, y := 60}

/- More generally, given an expression `p.foo x y z` where `p : Point`, Lean
will insert `p` at the first argument to `Point.foo` of type `Point`. For
example, with the definition of scalar multiplication below, `p.smul 3` is
interpreted as `Point.smul 3 p`. -/

def Point.smul (n : Nat) (p : Point Nat) :=
  Point.mk (n * p.x) (n * p.y)

#eval p
#eval p.smul 3  -- {x := 3, y := 6}

/- It is common to use a similar trick with the `List.map` function, which takes
a list as its second non-implicit argument. -/

#check @List.map

def xs : List Nat := [1, 2, 3]
def f : Nat → Nat := fun x => x * x

/- We want to calculate -/

#eval List.map f xs -- [1, 4, 9]

/- ### 1.1 (1 point).

Write an `#eval` statement with dot notation achieving the
same effect as the above. Check that they output the same values. -/

-- write your solution here

end
end LoVe



/- ### 1.2 (1 point).

Define the function `List.mySum` that sums the elements of a
`List ℕ`, using dot notation where applicable. -/

@[autogradedDef 1, validTactics #[rfl, simp [List.mySum]]]
def List.mySum : List ℕ → ℕ
:= sorry

namespace LoVe

/- ### 1.3 (1 point).

Write an `#eval` statement using dot notation that achieves
the same effect as the one below: -/

#eval List.mySum [1, 2, 3, 4]  -- 10
-- write your solution here


/- Dot notation even works for proofs! If `hpq : P ∧ Q`, then `hpq.left : P`
is syntax for `And.left hpq`. (Note that `∧` is syntax for the Proposition `And`.)

### 1.4 (1 point).

Write as short of a term mode proof as you can of the
following lemma, using dot notation at least once: -/

lemma dotAndSwap (P Q R : Prop) (hpq : P ∧ Q ∧ R) : Q ∧ P :=
sorry

/- ### Golf bonus (0 points).

When the expected type is an application of a type constructor `T`,
Lean allows you to omit the `T.` prefix in a theorem or definition name.
For example, `Nat.gcd` takes in two `Nat` arguments. We can write the
`gcd` of `0` and `2` as follows: -/

#eval Nat.gcd .zero (.succ (.succ .zero))

/- This is particularly powerful in combination with the precedence glyphs `<|`
("put parentheses around everything to the right") and `|>`
("put parentheses around everything to the left, and apply the function on
the right to that," or equivalently, "pipe the result on the left into the
function on the right.") -/

#eval Nat.gcd .zero <|.succ <|.succ .zero
#eval Nat.succ .zero |>.gcd .zero

/- Try to write a term mode proof of one direction of De Morgan's law
using as few parentheses (or as few characters) as possible.
(Or write down your own propositions and try it out!) -/
example (p q : Prop) : ¬ (p ∨ q) → ¬ p ∧ ¬ q :=
  sorry

/- ## Question 2 (9 points): Left-Commutative Functions

Recall that a function `f` is *commutative* if `f a b = f b a` for all `a`
and `b` in its domain. -/

def Commutative {α : Type} (f : α → α → α) : Prop :=
  ∀ (a b : α), f a b = f b a

/- Suppose we want to define a notion of commutativity for functions of type
`α → β → β`. (This type should look familiar: think about list folds!) The
definition above won't do, since if `f : α → β → β`, `a : α`, and `b : β`, then
`f a b` type-checks but `f b a` does not. However, if we have two (nested)
applications of `f` -- and thus two arguments of type `α` -- we can interchange
certain arguments in a type-safe way: if `a' : α`, then `f a (f a' b)` and
`f a' (f a b)` both type-check. The last argument remains fixed, but the `a` and
`a'` "commute" across the two applications of `f`. This motivates the following
definition.

A function `f` is called *left-commutative* if, for all arguments `a`, `a'`, and
`b`, it satisfies `f a (f a' b) = f a' (f a b)`. (The name comes from the fact
that it is only the arguments on the left that commute.) We define this in Lean
below: -/

def LeftCommutative {α β : Type} (f : α → β → β) : Prop :=
∀ (a a' : α) (b : β), f a (f a' b) = f a' (f a b)

/- If you squint a bit, left-commutativity has some similarity to both
commutativity and associativity. (Recall that a function `f` is *associative* if
`f (f a b) c = f a (f b c)` (in infix notation, `(a ⋆ b) ⋆ c = a ⋆ (b ⋆ c)`) for
all `a`, `b`, and `c` in its domain.) Let's investigate this connection. -/

def Associative {α : Type} (f : α → α → α) : Prop :=
  ∀ (a b c : α), f (f a b) c = f a (f b c)

/- ### 2.1 (1 point).

Show that if a function is both commutative and associative,
then it is left-commutative. -/

@[autogradedProof 1] theorem leftCommutative_of_commutative_associative {α : Type} :
  ∀ (f : α → α → α), Commutative f ∧ Associative f → LeftCommutative f :=
  sorry

/- ### 2.2 (4 points).

Show that a left-commutative function need not be commutative
or associative by constructing such a function `g` and proving that it is
left-commutative, nonassociative, and noncommutative.

Note: you're free to define `g` on any type you wish, but you will likely find a
"small" type (like `Bool`) more manageable.

Here are some helpful reminders for the proofs:

* You can create new hypotheses using the `have` keyword (e.g.,
  `have hyp_name : hyp_type := pf`)
* You use the `at` keyword to apply a tactic to a hypothesis (e.g.,
  `rw [Associative] at h`)
* The `contradiction` tactic can prove any goal (including `False`) if you have
  an "obviously" impossible hypothesis in your context (e.g., `true = false`) -/

def g : sorry := sorry

@[autogradedProof 1] theorem g_leftCommutative : LeftCommutative g :=
  sorry

@[autogradedProof 1] theorem g_not_commutative : ¬Commutative g :=
  sorry

@[autogradedProof 1] theorem g_not_associative : ¬Associative g :=
  sorry

/- Now that we've seen some properties of left-commutativity in the abstract,
let's look at its significance in the context that motivated its definition in
the first place: list folds.

We define below left and right list folds (note that our `foldl` has a
slightly different signature from the library version, allowing it to take a
combining function of the same type as `foldr`'s).

### 2.3 (3 points).
Show that if we fold a list using a left-commutative combining
function and the same initial accumulator, we get the same result regardless of
the direction in which we fold.

Hint: you will need to prove a helper lemma. (We suggest starting with the main
proof to figure out what that helper lemma should be.) -/

def foldl {α β : Type} : (α → β → β) → β → List α → β
  | f, z, []         => z
  | f, z, (x :: xs)  => foldl f (f x z) xs

def foldr {α β : Type} : (α → β → β) → β → List α → β
  | f, z, []        => z
  | f, z, (x :: xs) => f x (foldr f z xs)

@[autogradedProof 3] theorem foldl_eq_foldr_of_leftCommutative {α β : Type} :
  ∀ (g : α → β → β) (hg : LeftCommutative g) (z : β) (xs : List α),
  foldl g z xs = foldr g z xs :=
  sorry


/- ### 2.4 (1 point).

In fact, left-commutativity is not only sufficient for a
function to have the same left- and right-folding behavior; it is also
necessary. Prove this by showing that if some combining function always gives
equal left and right folds, then that function must be left-commutative. -/

@[autogradedProof 1] theorem leftCommutative_of_foldl_eq_foldr {α β : Type} :
  ∀ (g : α → β → β),
    (∀ (z : β) (xs : List α), foldl g z xs = foldr g z xs) →
    LeftCommutative g :=
  sorry



/- ## Question (7 points): Heterogeneous Lists

We've become familiar with `List`s, which contain multiple ordered values of the
same type. But what if we want to store values of different types? Can this be
done in a type-safe way?

Yes! Below we define `HList`, a type of *heterogeneous lists*. While `List` is
parametrized by a single type (e.g., a `List String` contains `String`s, and a
`List Bool` contains `Bool`s), `HList` is parametrized by a *list* of types.
Each element of this type-level list defines the type of the entry at the same
position in the `HList`. For instance, an `HList [Nat, String, Bool]` contains a
natural number in the first position, a string in the second position, and a
boolean in the third position. Be sure you see how this achieved by the
following inductive definition. -/

inductive HList : List Type → Type 1
  | nil : HList []
  | cons {α : Type} {αs : List Type} : α → HList αs → HList (α :: αs)

/- The following declarations are necessary to enable custom `HList` notation
and evaluation of `HList`s with `#eval`. You do not need to understand them, and
we suggest you "collapse" them in VS Code by hovering over the line number next
to `section` and clicking the arrow that appears. -/

-- We can write `HList`s using a syntax similar to lists:
#check H[]
#check 3 ::: "hi" ::: H[]
#check H[9, "hello", true]
#check H[("value", 4), (λ x => x + 1)]

/- If we write a function that adds, removes, or changes the types of elements
in an `HList`, therefore, we must also reflect these changes at the type level.
For instance, consider the function `HList.snoc` (which appends an element to
the end of an `HList`) below. Notice the parallel between the type it returns
and the structure of the data it returns!

Note: this is just a demonstration of how to declare a function on `HList`s.
Do not use `snoc` in any of the problems below! -/

def HList.snoc {α : Type} {αs : List Type} : HList αs → α → HList (αs ++ [α])
  | HList.nil      , y => HList.cons y HList.nil
  | HList.cons x xs, y => HList.cons x (HList.snoc xs y)

#check HList.snoc H[14, true] 52
#eval HList.snoc H[14, true] 52

/- ### 4.1 (1 point).

Write a function `HList.append` that appends two `HList`s together.
You'll need to complete the type as well as implement the function! -/

@[autogradedDef 1, validTactics #[rfl, simp [HList.append]]]
-- induction_and_simp 2 2 HList.append]]
def HList.append {αs βs : List Type} : HList αs → HList βs → sorry
  := sorry


/- Heterogeneous lists can be used in conjunction with traditional lists to
store multi-typed tabular data (similar to Pyret, for those who are familiar).
We can think of some `αs : List Type` as indicating the type stored in each
column and treat an `HList αs` as a row. Since every row contains the same types
as the others, a collection of such rows would simply be a list of values of
type `HList αs`. Therefore, a table, which is a collection of rows, is
represented by a value of type `List (HList αs)`. For instance, the following
table is represented by a `List (HList [String, String, Nat])`:

| **String**   | **String** | **Nat** |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| "Providence" | "RI"       | 2912    |
| "Pawtucket"  | "RI"       | 2860    |
| "Boston"     | "MA"       | 2110    |


But we can also think of a table as a collection of columns: each column
contains data of a single type and so is a traditional `List`, but since each
column has a different type, the collection of all the columns must be an
`HList`. For instance, the column-wise representation of the above would have
type `HList [List String, List String, List Nat]`.

Since these representations are storing equivalent data, it would be useful to
be able to convert between them. This conversion will be our focus for the rest
of this question.

### 4.2 (1 point).
Let `αs : List Type` represent the types stored in a given row of
a table with row-wise representation of type `List (HList αs)`. Complete the
definition of a function below that maps `αs` to some `βs : List Type` such that
`HList βs` is the type of the column-wise representation of that same table.

  sorry

/-
### 4.3 (2 points).
Now that we can state its type, implement the function
`listHlistToHlistList` that converts the row-wise representation of a table
into a column-wise representation.

Hint: Notice that we've put `αs` to the right of the colon in the definition, so
you'll need to match both it and the input list in your pattern-match. (I wonder
why we'd do that...) -/

-- You may use these helper functions in your solution
def HList.hd {α αs} : HList (α :: αs) → α
  | HList.cons x _ => x

def HList.tl {α αs} : HList (α :: αs) → HList αs
  | HList.cons _ xs => xs

def listHlistToHlistList :
  ∀ {αs : List Type}, List (HList αs) → HList (columnwiseType αs)
  := sorry

/- But what about the other direction? We might be tempted to declare a function
that turns a collection of columns into a collection of rows. That function
might have this signature: -/

opaque hlistListToListHlist :
  ∀ {αs : List Type}, HList (columnwiseType αs) → List (HList αs)

/- We can describe the type of behavior we expect this function to have. For
instance, `hlistListToListHlist` shouldn't change the number of rows in a table:
the number of rows in the column-wise representation we give the function
should be equal to the number of rows in the row-wise representation we get out.

We define this property below in the case of a two-column table below. (Notice
that we're just *defining* the property; we haven't proved it!) -/

def length_hllh : Prop :=
  ∀ (α β : Type) (t : HList (columnwiseType [α, β])),
  List.length (hlistListToListHlist t) = List.length (HList.hd t)


/-
### 4.4 (2 points).
But, in fact, we cannot define a function with this behavior!
Prove that `length_hllh` is false. This shows that, regardless of how we try to
implement a function `hlistListToListHlist`, it *cannot* have the property
`length_hllh`.

Hint 1: Read `length_hllh` carefully. It might not say exactly what we claimed.

Hint 2: You may find `Empty.elim` helpful. -/

#check @Empty.elim

-- Here's a helper function you might also find helpful: if a list of `τ`s has
-- length 1, then we can obtain a `τ` from it (if needed, you can change `1` to
-- any positive value below and the definition will still compile):
def pickFromSingletonList {τ} : ∀ {xs : List τ}, List.length xs = 1 → τ
  | x :: _, _ => x

@[autogradedProof 2]
theorem length_hllh_false : ¬ length_hllh :=
  sorry

/- ### 4.5 (1 point).

In fact, without using features of Lean we haven't yet seen,
we can only write down one function with type
`∀ {αs : List Type}, HList (columnwise_type αs) → List (HList αs)`,
and it does not satisfy the property in `length_hllh`. Describe this function's
behavior and why it is the only function with this type. Then explain what we
would need to be able to assume about the argument to `hlistListToListHlist` in
order to create a function that inverts the row-column representation as we
desire. -/

/-
Write your answer to part 5 here.
-/

/- A final note! This is not the only possible encoding of a heterogeneous list.
Below, we declare a type `HList'` that stores heterogeneously typed data but
does *not* contain any data about the types it contains at type level. We also
declare a function `HList'.append` that appends two heterogeneous lists of this
type. -/

inductive HList'
  | nil : HList'
  | cons {α : Type} : α → HList' → HList'

def HList'.append : HList' → HList' → HList'
  | HList'.nil,       ys => ys
  | HList'.cons x xs, ys => HList'.cons x (HList'.append xs ys)

/- Food for thought: what are some pros and cons of this approach compared to
`HList`? (How easy is each to declare? To extract data from? How confident
are you that each `append` function is correct by virtue of the fact that it
type-checks?)

We won't be grading your answers here, but if you'd like to share your thoughts,
we're happy to read them! -/
